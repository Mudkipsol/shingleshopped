# Favicon Setup Complete

Your layout.tsx has been updated to use favicon.png from the public directory.

To complete the setup:
1. Save your 'logo (2).png' file as 'favicon.png' in the shingleshop-website/public/ directory
2. Commit and push to your repository
3. Netlify will automatically redeploy with your new favicon

Your layout.tsx now includes:
- favicon.png (main favicon)
- favicon.ico (fallback)
- apple-touch-icon.png (iOS devices)
